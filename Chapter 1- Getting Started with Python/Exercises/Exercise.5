## Exercise 5: Compute area of Circle :ballot_box_with_check:
Write a Python program which accepts the radius of a circle from the user and compute the area.

# import math module
from math import pi
 
# take input from user
r = float(input ("Input the radius of the circle : "))
 
# compute the area from radius of a circle given by user
calculateArea = str(pi * r**2);
 
#print result
print ("The area of the circle with radius " + str(r) + " is: " + calculateArea)
